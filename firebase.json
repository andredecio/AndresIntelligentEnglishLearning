    // but then you would need to configure targets in .firebaserc as well, which is more complex for CI.
    // For a single target deployment to the default site, this simpler structure is best.

    // Add any other hosting configurations specific to this site here
    // For example, rewrites, headers, cleanUrls, etc. from your original firebase.json
  }
  // Keep any other service configurations here (e.g., "functions", "firestore")
  // Ensure you have a "project": {"default": "your-project-id"} or similar in your .firebaserc
  // in your repository's root for the Firebase CLI to know which project to use.
