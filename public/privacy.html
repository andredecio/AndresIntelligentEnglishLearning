    <h1>Privacy Policy for My Firebase Course System</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how "My Firebase Course System" (the "Application") processes information when you use it. This Application is developed and intended for personal educational use only by its creator, Andres.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>This Application processes information directly from your Google Account for the purpose of interacting with Google Classroom. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your Google User ID (UID)</li>
        <li>Access to your Google Classroom courses, coursework, and roster data (only as necessary to create and manage course content as initiated by you within the Application).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No personal data beyond what is necessary for Google Classroom integration, as initiated by your actions, is collected or stored by this Application's backend (Firebase Cloud Functions, Firestore).</p>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>The information accessed is used solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create and manage courses within your Google Classroom account as per your explicit commands.</li>
        <li>Organize and populate course content based on your Firestore data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not share any of your personal information with third parties.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>All data processed by this Application uses Google's secure Firebase and Google Cloud infrastructure, which includes robust security measures. Your Google credentials are never handled directly by the Application; all authentication is managed securely via Google's OAuth 2.0 system.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
